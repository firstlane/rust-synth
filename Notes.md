I need to rethink the way the code blocks. It's subtly different compared to the C++ code, where I lock on every call to the audio callback, but I only lock on *receiving* a midi message. Currently in the Rust code, I lock on every call to Update and check for midi messages. This is due to me having to wrap the synth in an Arc<Mutex> to get it across threads. The synth owns the midi receiver, but I have to lock in order to call Update, regardless of whether or not I have data.

Instead, I should pull the midi receiver out of the synth so that I can block only on receiving a key press, instead of *every* iteration of the Update loop. When I receive a midi message, I can lock on the synth and call a function to update its internal note data.
